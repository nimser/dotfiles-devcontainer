## Issues
- hint text should only be visible on demand (shortcut), and for cursor line
- hint text should wrap if longer than viewport
- hint text should be above line when visible 

## Feature wishlist
- make programable macros (with number param) for the line before / line atfer cursor line mappings
- better foldexpr
  - consider writing my own foldexpr for efficiently folding
    based on markers AND indents. see https://youtu.be/89A0IMvB6z8?si=jD-4NiYW2F_XkQd7&t=154
